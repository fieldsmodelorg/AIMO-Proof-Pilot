# AIMO Proof Pilot — grading task

You are an **expert olympiad grader** for the AIMO Proof Pilot. Your job is to grade **one**
submission against the official markscheme and return a completed grading sheet as a LaTeX
(`.tex`) file.

- **Problem:** `4_COLOUR`
- **Submission:** `team_4`

Grade the submission's argument **on its own merits against the markscheme** — *not* on how
closely it resembles the reference solution. Work carefully and verify every step against the
markscheme before deciding a mark.

## How to grade

**Scoring scale — 0 / 1 / 6 / 7, decided by two binary questions:**

1. **Is the solution essentially complete?** (allowing only minor slips described in the markscheme)
   - **No** → award **1** for *significant partial progress*, otherwise **0**.
   - **Yes** → award **7**, or **6** if there is a *minor error or omission*.

The bar for "essentially complete" is **stricter than the IMO**, and partial credit is
**harsher** (no 2–5 continuum). An *accumulation* of small omissions can amount to a material
hole, dropping an otherwise-complete solution into the 0/1 band.

**Use the markscheme's labelled points.** Each problem's markscheme lists:
- **ME** — minor errors/omissions that turn 7 → 6.
- **NME** — slips that should *not* be penalised.
- **NEC** — gaps that mean the solution is *not essentially complete* (cap at 0/1).
- **NPP** — things that are *not* enough, on their own, for the 1-mark partial-progress band.

When logging issues, map severity to these: **NME → trivial**, **ME → minor**, **NEC → major**.

**Alternative approaches.** Olympiad problems admit many valid routes. If the submission
differs from the reference solution, map its argument onto the **same milestones** in the
markscheme — an alternative that reaches the equivalent decisive step earns the equivalent
credit. Record your mapping and rationale in the "Significantly different approach?" box and
flag it.

**What counts as an error.** Flag not only false statements and logical gaps but also:
answering the **wrong problem**, **changing or weakening a hypothesis** from the one given,
proving a different statement, or assuming what was to be proved — these are usually **major**.
Reference the **line numbers** of the numbered submission below for every issue you log. If the
solution is entirely wrong (a clear 0), you need not catalogue every error — label the most
serious ones and note that minor errors were not itemised.

**Where to focus (in order):** (1) the **proposed mark + reasoning**, (2) the **errors/issues
log** with line numbers, (3) the two **proof-quality** questions (qualitative, lowest priority,
do **not** affect the mark).

\section*{Problem 4 (COLOUR)}


\problem[4]{%
Linda and Sue play a game on a $2025\times 2025$ grid of cells. Initially, every cell is grey. Linda moves first, and the players then alternate turns.

On each of Linda's turns, she chooses one cell and paints it lime, regardless of its current colour. On each of Sue's turns, she chooses an axis-aligned $2 \times 2$ block of cells containing at least one grey cell, and paints all four cells scarlet, regardless of their current colours.

After each move, if there are no grey cells left, the game ends immediately. Linda wants to maximise the number of cells whose final colour is lime, and Sue wants to maximise the number of cells whose final colour is scarlet.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item Prove that the game always ends after finitely many moves.
    \item Suppose both players play optimally. Determine the number of lime cells at the end of the game.
\end{enumerate}
}{1026168}

\vspace{2cm}

\textbf{Original AIMO3 Formulation:} 

Linda and Sue play a game on a $2025 \times 2025$ grey square grid as follows. Linda starts by picking a cell of any colour and painting it lime. Then Sue picks a $2 \times 2$ square, at least one of which is grey, and paints all four cells scarlet (including any cells already painted lime). They alternate turns with the game finishing immediately once no cell is grey. Linda wants to maximise the number of lime cells and Sue wants to maximise the number of scarlet cells. If both players play optimally, the game will end with $L$ lime cells. What is the remainder when $L$ is divided by $10^5$?

\textbf{Answer:} 26168

\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Remark:} Relative to the AIMO3 version, we have made it more explicit how the game progresses, and that the players' objectives are determined by the final colours of the cells. We regard the intended meaning of the original formulation as clear in context, but these small changes remove possible sources of misreading. We have also added part \emph{a)} to make explicit that the game always terminates, so that the optimisation question in part \emph{b)} is well-defined.

\clearpage

\polishedsolution[SB][4]{%
We prove a slightly more general statement. For an $n \times n$ grid with $n \geq 2$, if both players play optimally then the final number of lime cells is
\begin{equation*}
    \left\lceil \frac{n}{2}\right\rceil^2 - 1.
\end{equation*}
Substituting $n=2025$ gives
\begin{equation*}
    L=\left\lceil\frac{2025}{2}\right\rceil^2 - 1=1013^2-1=\boxed{1026168}.
\end{equation*}

We first prove part \emph{a)}. On each of Sue's turns, she is required to choose a $2 \times 2$ square containing at least one grey cell. After she paints the square scarlet, at least one formerly grey cell is no longer grey. Linda's move cannot increase the number of grey cells. Therefore the number of grey cells strictly decreases on every Sue turn, and there are only finitely many grey cells to begin with. Hence the game must end after finitely many turns.

Partition the grid into a grid of $2 \times 2$ squares. If $n$ is odd, as it is in the problem here, extend down and right to a $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ grid and partition there, then restrict to the original grid. We get $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2} \right\rceil^2$ regions which we call \emph{compartments}, each of which has a unique top-left cell which we call \emph{special}. Every $2 \times 2$ square of the grid, not necessarily a compartment, contains exactly one special cell. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{../figures/fig_1.tex}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Linda's strategy:} Linda's strategy is to pick a non-special cell on her first move, then for every move after Sue's, to paint the special cell in Sue's previous $2 \times 2$ square lime. First, note that if Sue never paints a fixed special cell, then Linda never does either, so the game will not have ended. Thus, by the time the game has ended, Sue has painted all special cells at least once. Next, note that Linda will always paint over a non-grey cell after her first move, hence Sue makes the last move in order to remove the final grey cell(s). 

Other than the unique special cell in this last $2 \times 2$ square, fix a special cell and consider the last time it is painted scarlet. Immediately after, it is painted lime and remains that way. Thus, other than the last special cell, all special cells are lime, and hence at least $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil^2 - 1$ are lime at the end.

\textbf{Sue's strategy:} Sue's goal of maximising the number of scarlet cells is the same as minimising the number of lime cells since at the end of the game every cell is coloured one or the other. After Linda's first move, Sue chooses one of the four rotated compartment decompositions such that the lime cell does not lie in its own $1 \times 1$ compartment (which would be the bottom right cell for $n$ odd). Then, Sue picks the compartment containing this lime cell, which necessarily contains a grey cell, and paints a $2 \times 2$ square which covers it (which may overlap a neighbouring compartment if the chosen compartment lies on the boundary). On Sue's subsequent turns, she selects any compartment with a grey cell and paints a legal $2 \times 2$ square covering that compartment.

After Sue picks a compartment, she will not pick it again as it does not contain any grey cells. Hence, the game ends on or before Sue's $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil^2$th move. Thus, there are at most as many lime cells remaining as there are Linda moves after Sue's first move, hence at most $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil^2 - 1$ lime cells.

Putting these together gives the required value for $L$.
}

\clearpage

\markscheme{
Let $M=1013^2-1$, the correct value of $L$.

A solution is \emph{essentially complete} if it proves that the game always terminates and proves that $L \in \{M-1,M,M+1\}$. This requires providing and proving a strategy for Linda to obtain at least $M-1$ lime cells and a strategy for Sue to restrict Linda to at most $M+1$ lime cells.

An essentially complete solution that fails to prove the exact value $L=M$ should score $6$ marks.

An essentially complete solution should also receive $6$ rather than $7$ if it contains a minor error or omission: a gap which is not merely a small arithmetic slip, but which can be repaired without changing the main structure of the solution. Examples include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(ME\arabic*)]
    \item In Linda's strategy, failing to explain why all special cells except possibly the one in Sue's final square are lime at the end.
    \item In Sue's strategy, failing to justify that boundary compartments can be covered by legal $2\times2$ squares.
    \item In Sue's strategy, failing to explain why Linda's first lime cell is overwritten on Sue's first move.
    \item Making a fixable off-by-one error in counting Sue's compartment-clearing moves or Linda's remaining moves, while the intended strategy and final value are otherwise clear.
\end{enumerate}

We generally will not penalise minor arithmetic mistakes unless they are integral to the solution. The final answer may be left as a basic arithmetic expression, such as $1013^2-1$; it does not have to be explicitly calculated as $1026168$ to score full marks.
}{%
If a solution is not essentially complete, it should score $1$ if it proves at least one of the following substantial one-sided results.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(PP\arabic*)]
    \item A valid Linda strategy guaranteeing at least
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\lfloor \frac{2025}{2} \right\rfloor^2-1=1012^2-1=1024143
    \end{equation*}
    lime cells at the end. For example, this might be a correct special-cell strategy on a $2024\times2024$ sub-board, even if it does not handle the last row and column sharply.

    \item A valid Sue strategy guaranteeing at most
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\lceil \frac{2025}{2} \right\rceil^2=1013^2=1026169
    \end{equation*}
    lime cells at the end. For example, this might be a compartment-clearing strategy with a remaining unresolved off-by-one.
\end{enumerate}

The following do \emph{not} count as significant partial progress on their own.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(NPP\arabic*)]
    \item Proving only that the game terminates.
    \item Stating the correct answer, or the correct expression $1013^2-1$, without a proof of optimality.
    \item Checking small cases or giving numerical evidence without a strategy for the $2025\times2025$ board.
    \item Giving only trivial bounds, such as $0\leq L\leq2025^2$.
    \item Describing a $2\times2$ tiling of the board without deriving a substantial lower or upper bound from it.
    \item Giving a strategy that works only if the opponent cooperates, rather than against every legal move of the opponent.
\end{enumerate}
}

## Submission to grade

This is the submission `team_4` for problem `4_COLOUR`, with line numbers
added for reference in your errors log.

```text
  1 | We first prove that the game always ends after finitely many moves.  
  2 | Initially there are \(2025^2\) grey cells.  
  3 | On each turn, Linda paints exactly one cell lime. If she paints a grey cell, the number of grey cells decreases by 1; if she paints a cell that is already lime or scarlet, the number of grey cells does not change.  
  4 | On each turn, Sue chooses a \(2\times2\) block that contains at least one grey cell and paints all four cells scarlet. Hence the number of grey cells decreases by at least 1.  
  5 | Thus after every move the number of grey cells is at least one less than before, unless Linda paints a non‑grey cell and Sue’s move does not reduce the count? Actually, Sue always reduces the count by at least 1, so after each of her moves the number of grey cells decreases by at least 1. Since there are only finitely many cells, the game must end after at most \(2025^2\) moves. This proves part (a).
  6 | 
  7 | Now we determine the number of lime cells at the end under optimal play.  
  8 | Let \(n=2025\) (odd).  
  9 | 
 10 | **Lower bound (Linda can guarantee at least one lime cell).**  
 11 | Linda chooses a corner, say \((1,1)\), as her first move.  
 12 | The only \(2\times2\) block containing \((1,1)\) is the top‑left block, and it contains three grey cells.  
 13 | Sue must paint that block on her first turn.  
 14 | After Sue’s move that block is all scarlet.  
 15 | Linda then paints \((1,1)\) lime on her second turn.  
 16 | The only block containing \((1,1)\) is now all scarlet, so \((1,1)\) will never be painted scarlet again.  
 17 | Thus Linda can ensure at least one lime cell.
 18 | 
 19 | **Upper bound (Sue can guarantee at most one lime cell).**  
 20 | We construct a pairing of the cells of the \(2025\times2025\) grid that has the following property: every pair of cells is contained in the same \(2\times2\) block, and the central cell \(C=(1013,1013)\) is left unpaired.  
 21 | Because the grid is odd, such a pairing exists. One explicit pairing is obtained by tiling the grid with disjoint \(2\times2\) blocks that cover all cells except \(C\) (e.g., take the blocks with top‑left corners \((1,1),(1,3),\dots,(2023,2023)\) for the first \(2024\) rows and columns, and then handle the remaining border cells with additional blocks, a standard construction).  
 22 | 
 23 | Su’s strategy:  
 24 | - If Linda paints a cell \(X\) that is not the central cell \(C\), Su paints the \(2\times2\) block that contains the partner of \(X\) in the pairing.  
 25 | - If Linda paints the central cell \(C\), Su paints any \(2\times2\) block that contains a grey cell (such a block exists because the game has not ended).  
 26 | 
 27 | We claim that under this strategy no cell other than \(C\) can ever become safe, and the game will end with exactly one safe cell (the central cell).  
 28 | 
 29 | *Why no other cell can become safe.*  
 30 | For any cell \(X\neq C\), its partner \(Y\) is in the same \(2\times2\) block.  
 31 | When Linda paints \(X\), Su immediately paints the block containing \(Y\) (which also contains \(X\) because the pair lies in the same block).  
 32 | Thus after Su’s move, the entire block becomes scarlet, and in particular \(X\) is painted scarlet. Hence \(X\) is never lime, and even if Linda later paints it again, it would be painted scarlet at that moment (since the block is already scarlet) and cannot become safe.  
 33 | If Linda ever paints a cell that is already scarlet, it remains scarlet, so it cannot become safe.  
 34 | Therefore the only cell that can possibly become safe is the central cell \(C\), because Su never paints the block containing \(C\) (the pairing leaves \(C\) unpaired, and the strategy never selects that block).  
 35 | 
 36 | *Why the game ends with exactly one safe cell.*  
 37 | Since Su always paints a block that contains a grey cell, the number of grey cells decreases each time she moves.  
 38 | The total number of grey cells is finite, so the game must end after finitely many moves.  
 39 | When the game ends, there are no grey cells.  
 40 | All cells except possibly \(C\) have been painted scarlet by Su’s moves.  
 41 | Linda may at some point paint \(C\) lime.  
 42 | If she does so, \(C\) becomes lime and, because every \(2\times2\) block containing \(C\) has already been painted scarlet (by Su’s moves, since the block containing \(C\) is not painted by Su but its cells are all scarlet because the other cells in those blocks were painted scarlet), \(C\) will never be painted scarlet later. Hence \(C\) is safe.  
 43 | If Linda never paints \(C\), then no cell is safe, but Linda can always choose to paint \(C\) at the last move to obtain a safe cell; since Linda wants to maximise the number of lime cells, she will do so.  
 44 | Thus under optimal play, exactly one lime cell remains.
 45 | 
 46 | Therefore the number of lime cells at the end is \(\boxed{1}\).

Label the most serious ones --- enough to justify the mark --- and add a final row (or a note) recording that there were further minor errors which you have not itemised.

\paragraph{What counts as an error.} Flag as errors not only false statements and logical gaps, but also issues such as \textbf{answering the wrong problem}, \textbf{using a different set of conditions from those given in the problem} (e.g.\ silently changing or weakening a hypothesis), proving a different statement from the one asked, or assuming what was to be proved.
