# AIMO Proof Pilot — grading task

You are an **expert olympiad grader** for the AIMO Proof Pilot. Your job is to grade **one**
submission against the official markscheme and return a completed grading sheet as a LaTeX
(`.tex`) file.

- **Problem:** `5_POLYGO`
- **Submission:** `model_5`

Grade the submission's argument **on its own merits against the markscheme** — *not* on how
closely it resembles the reference solution. Work carefully and verify every step against the
markscheme before deciding a mark.

## How to grade

**Scoring scale — 0 / 1 / 6 / 7, decided by two binary questions:**

1. **Is the solution essentially complete?** (allowing only minor slips described in the markscheme)
   - **No** → award **1** for *significant partial progress*, otherwise **0**.
   - **Yes** → award **7**, or **6** if there is a *minor error or omission*.

The bar for "essentially complete" is **stricter than the IMO**, and partial credit is
**harsher** (no 2–5 continuum). An *accumulation* of small omissions can amount to a material
hole, dropping an otherwise-complete solution into the 0/1 band.

**Use the markscheme's labelled points.** Each problem's markscheme lists:
- **ME** — minor errors/omissions that turn 7 → 6.
- **NME** — slips that should *not* be penalised.
- **NEC** — gaps that mean the solution is *not essentially complete* (cap at 0/1).
- **NPP** — things that are *not* enough, on their own, for the 1-mark partial-progress band.

When logging issues, map severity to these: **NME → trivial**, **ME → minor**, **NEC → major**.

**Alternative approaches.** Olympiad problems admit many valid routes. If the submission
differs from the reference solution, map its argument onto the **same milestones** in the
markscheme — an alternative that reaches the equivalent decisive step earns the equivalent
credit. Record your mapping and rationale in the "Significantly different approach?" box and
flag it.

**What counts as an error.** Flag not only false statements and logical gaps but also:
answering the **wrong problem**, **changing or weakening a hypothesis** from the one given,
proving a different statement, or assuming what was to be proved — these are usually **major**.
Reference the **line numbers** of the numbered submission below for every issue you log. If the
solution is entirely wrong (a clear 0), you need not catalogue every error — label the most
serious ones and note that minor errors were not itemised.

**Where to focus (in order):** (1) the **proposed mark + reasoning**, (2) the **errors/issues
log** with line numbers, (3) the two **proof-quality** questions (qualitative, lowest priority,
do **not** affect the mark).

\textbf{Original AIMO3 Formulation:} 

A polynomial $P(x)$ is called \emph{good} if it has integer coefficients and:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a monic polynomial of degree 7;
    \item The absolute values of all of the coefficients of $P$ are odd and strictly less than $2025^2$;
    \item The absolute values of all the coefficients of $P$ are roots of $P$.
\end{itemize}
There are $N$ good polynomials. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $10^{5}$?

\textbf{Answer:} 50968

\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Remark:} Relative to the AIMO3 version, we removed the modulo $10^5$ answer modification as we are not restricted to $5$-digit answers in the Proof Pilot.

\polishedsolution[SB][4]{%
Write
\begin{equation*}
    P(x)=x^7+a_6x^6+a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0,
\end{equation*}
and put $M=2025^2$. Let $N$ be the largest absolute value of any coefficient of $P$, including the leading coefficient. Then $N$ is odd, $1\leq N<M$, and both $1$ and $N$ are roots of $P$.

First suppose $N=1$. Then each of $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_6$ is equal to $1$ or $-1$. Since $1$ is a root,
\begin{equation*}
    0=P(1)=1+a_6+a_5+\cdots+a_0.
\end{equation*}
Thus exactly three of $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_6$ are equal to $1$, and the remaining four are equal to $-1$. This gives
\begin{equation*}
    \binom{7}{3}=35
\end{equation*}
polynomials.

We present two approaches for classifying the cases where $N \geq 3$.

\underline{Approach 1: Right to Left}

We determine the coefficients in pairs, starting from the constant term. We shall repeatedly use the following simple observation: if $b$ is odd, $|b|\leq N$, $\varepsilon\in\{\pm1\}$, and
\begin{equation*}
    b+\varepsilon\equiv 0\pmod N,
\end{equation*}
then $b=-\varepsilon$. Indeed, $b+\varepsilon$ is even and has absolute value at most $N+1<2N$, while the only multiples of the odd number $N$ in this range are $-N,0,N$, of which only $0$ is even.

Since $P(N)=0$, reducing modulo $N$ gives $a_0\equiv0\pmod N$. As $0<|a_0|\leq N$ and is odd, we have $a_0=\varepsilon_0N$ for some $\varepsilon_0\in\{\pm1\}$. Dividing $P(N)=0$ by $N$ and reducing modulo $N$ gives
\begin{equation*}
    a_1+\varepsilon_0\equiv0\pmod N,
\end{equation*}
so by the observation $a_1=-\varepsilon_0$. Hence
\begin{equation*}
    a_1\in\{\pm1\},\quad a_0=-a_1N.
\end{equation*}

The same argument may now be repeated after deleting this cancelling pair. Since $a_1N+a_0=0$, dividing the remaining equation by $N^2$ gives
\begin{equation*}
    0=N^5+a_6N^4+a_5N^3+a_4N^2+a_3N+a_2.
\end{equation*}
Applying the same two congruence steps gives
\begin{equation*}
    a_3\in\{\pm1\},\quad a_2=-a_3N.
\end{equation*}
Deleting this pair and dividing by $N^4$ leaves
\begin{equation*}
    0=N^3+a_6N^2+a_5N+a_4,
\end{equation*}
so similarly
\begin{equation*}
    a_5\in\{\pm1\},\quad a_4=-a_5N.
\end{equation*}
Finally the remaining part of $P(N)=0$ is $N^7+a_6N^6=0$, so $a_6=-N$.

Therefore every good polynomial with $N\geq3$ has the form
\begin{equation*}
    P(x)=x^7-Nx^6+s_1(x^5-Nx^4)+s_2(x^3-Nx^2)+s_3(x-N),
\end{equation*}
where $s_1,s_2,s_3\in\{\pm1\}$. Since $1$ is a root,
\begin{equation*}
    0=P(1)=(1-N)(1+s_1+s_2+s_3).
\end{equation*}
As $N>1$, this is equivalent to
\begin{equation*}
    s_1+s_2+s_3=-1.
\end{equation*}
Thus exactly one of $s_1,s_2,s_3$ is $1$ and the other two are $-1$. There are $3$ ways to assign these values. 

Conversely, for every odd integer $N$ with $3\leq N<M$, every polynomial of the displayed form with exactly one of $s_1,s_2,s_3$ equal to $1$ is good: its coefficient absolute values are just $1$ and $N$, the equation $P(N)=0$ follows from the cancellation in each block, and $P(1)=0$ follows from $1+s_1+s_2+s_3=0$.

It remains to count the possible values of $N$. Since the coefficient absolute values must be strictly less than $M=2025^2$, and $M$ is odd, the odd values with $N\geq3$ are
\begin{equation*}
    3,5,7,\ldots,M-2,
\end{equation*}
so there are $(M-3)/2$ choices.


\underline{Approach 2: Left to Right}

We begin with the observation that for any positive integer $t$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Eqn1}
    N^t+N^{t-1}+\cdots+N+1=N^{t}+\frac{N^t-1}{N-1}<2N^t. \tag{$\ast$}
\end{equation}
We also note that, from the third condition, $P(N)=0$. If $a_6 \geq 2-N$ then
\begin{align*}
    0=P(N) &=N^7+a_6 N^6+a_5 N^5+\cdots+a_1 N+a_0  \\
    & \geq N^7+(2-N) N^6-N \cdot N^5-\cdots-N \cdot N-N \\ 
    &=2N^6-N \cdot \underbrace{\left(N^5+N^4+\cdots+1\right)}_{<2N^5 \; \text{by \eqref{eq:Eqn1}}} \\
    &>2N^6-N\left(2N^5\right)=0
\end{align*}
which is a contradiction. Thus, $a_6$ is equal to either $1-N$ or $-N$. As $N$ and $a_6$ are both odd, it follows that $a_6=-N$. 

Now we have 
\begin{equation*}
    0=P(N)=N^7-N \cdot N^6+a_5 N^5+\cdots+a_1 N+a_0=a_5 N^5+\cdots+a_1 N+a_0.
\end{equation*}
Subtracting $a_5 N^5$ from both sides and applying the triangle inequality
\begin{align*}
    \left\lvert -a_5 N^5\right\rvert=\left\lvert a_5 \right\rvert N^5
    &=
    \left\lvert a_4 N^4+\cdots+a_1 N+a_0 \right\rvert \\
    & \leq \left\lvert a_4\right\rvert N^4+\cdots+\left\lvert a_1\right\rvert N+\left\lvert a_0\right\rvert  \\
    & \leq N \cdot N^4+\cdots+N \cdot N+N \\
    & < N \left(2N^4\right)=2N^5 \tag{By \eqref{eq:Eqn1}}
    .
\end{align*}
Thus, $\left\lvert a_5\right\rvert<2$ which means, since $a_5$ is odd, that $a_5=\pm 1$. Noting that 
\begin{equation*}
    0=P(N)=a_5 N^5+a_4 N^4+\cdots+a_1N+a_0=\pm \left(N^5 \pm a_4 N^4+\cdots \pm a_1 N \pm a_0\right)
\end{equation*}
we can repeat the argument from above (for $a_6=-N$) to get $\pm a_4=-N$ so $a_4=-a_5N$. We then have
\begin{equation*}
    0=P(N)=a_5 N^5-\left(a_5N\right)N^4+a_3N^3+\cdots+a_1N+a_0=a_3N^3+\cdots+a_1N+a_0.
\end{equation*}
Again, we can repeat the argument that gave $a_5=\pm 1$ and $a_4=-a_5N$ to get $a_3=\pm 1$ and $a_2=-a_3N$. 

Lastly, we note that $0=P(N)=a_1N+a_0$ so, by the same argument, $a_1=\pm 1$ and $a_0=-a_1N$. Putting these all together we have
\begin{equation*}
    P(x)=x^7-Nx^6 \pm \left(x^5-Nx^4\right) \pm \left(x^3-Nx^2\right) \pm \left(x-N\right).
\end{equation*}
The count is then the same as the first approach. 

Combining with the $35$ choices for $P$ when $N=1$, we get
\begin{equation*}
    35+3 \cdot \frac{M-3}{2}=\frac{3M+61}{2}
\end{equation*}
choices for $P$ in total. Substituting in $M=2025^2$, we get the answer
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{3 \cdot 2025^2+61}{2}=\boxed{6150968}.
\end{equation*}
}

\markscheme{%
A solution is \emph{essentially complete} if, for $N \geq 3$, it shows that any good $P$ has the form
\begin{equation*}
    P(x)=x^7-Nx^6 \pm \left(x^5-Nx^4\right) \pm \left(x^3-Nx^2\right) \pm \left(x-N\right)
\end{equation*}
where $N$ is the largest absolute value of a coefficient. 

Any solution that fails to then reduce this to the correct count of good polynomials will score $6$. 

We will not penalise arithmetic errors in computing the final answer (e.g. if there is a correct proof that there are $\frac{3M+61}{2}$ good polynomials but the calculation goes wrong when substituting in $2025^2$).

Other examples of minor errors or omissions that would result in a score of $6$ include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(ME\arabic*)]
    \item Using $N\leq2025^2$ instead of $N<2025^2$ in the final count, thereby allowing the inadmissible value $N=2025^2$.
    \item Counting the odd values of $N\geq3$ as $(M-1)/2$ rather than $(M-3)/2$, where $M=2025^2$.
    \item Omitting the $N=1$ case, or counting it in a way that is not a minor arithmetic slip.
    \item Failing to impose $P(1)=0$ on the three signs, for example giving $8$ sign choices instead of $3$.
    \item Not checking the converse direction when the construction is not already visibly reversible.
\end{enumerate}

The following should \emph{not} generally be penalised:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(NME\arabic*)]
    \item A simple arithmetic slip in evaluating $2025^2$ or the final division, provided the correct expression $35+3(M-3)/2$ or $(3M+61)/2$ has been obtained.
    \item Not explicitly stating that $M=2025^2$ is odd, if the subsequent range $3,5,\ldots,M-2$ is counted correctly.
    \item A very brief converse check, provided it clearly notes that the only coefficient absolute values in the constructed polynomial are $1$ and $N$ and that both are roots.
\end{enumerate}
}{%
An incomplete solution scores $1$ mark if it makes a correct, non-trivial structural deduction in the case $N\geq3$. Any one of the following is sufficient:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(PP\arabic*)]
    \item Proving that $a_6=-N$.
    \item Proving that $a_0=\pm N$ \textbf{and} $a_1=\mp 1$ (where the sign choices are opposite).
    \item Proving any full adjacent pair relation, such as $a_4=-a_5N$ with $a_5\in\{\pm1\}$.
\end{enumerate}

\clearpage

The following do \emph{not} by themselves constitute partial progress:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(NPP\arabic*)]
    \item Counting the $N=1$ case only.
    \item Merely observing that $P(1)=0$ or $P(N)=0$.
    \item Making claims that $a_6=-N$ or $a_0=\pm N$ without proof.
    \item Finding the correct numerical answer by search, guessing, or pattern-spotting without a proof of the main structure.
    \item Counting sign patterns for the block form when the block form has not been justified.
\end{enumerate}

## Submission to grade

This is the submission `model_5` for problem `5_POLYGO`, with line numbers
added for reference in your errors log.

```text
  1 | Write
  2 | [
  3 | P(x)=x^7+a_6x^6+\cdots+a_1x+a_0
  4 | ]
  5 | and set
  6 | [
  7 | A=|a_0|.
  8 | ]
  9 | By hypothesis, (A) is a positive odd integer less than (2025^2), and (P(A)=0).
 10 | 
 11 | Since (A) is an integer root and (P) is monic,
 12 | [
 13 | P(x)=(x-A)Q(x)
 14 | ]
 15 | for some monic (Q\in\mathbb Z[x]) of degree (6). Moreover,
 16 | [
 17 | Q(0)=-\frac{a_0}{A}\in{-1,1}.
 18 | ]
 19 | 
 20 | Now let (b) be the absolute value of any coefficient of (P). Then (P(b)=0). If (b\ne A), then
 21 | [
 22 | 0=P(b)=(b-A)Q(b),
 23 | ]
 24 | so (Q(b)=0). Since (b) is a positive integer root of the monic polynomial (Q), the rational-root theorem gives
 25 | [
 26 | b\mid Q(0).
 27 | ]
 28 | But (|Q(0)|=1), hence (b=1).
 29 | 
 30 | Therefore every coefficient of (P) has absolute value either (1) or (A).
 31 | 
 32 | ### Case 1: (A=1)
 33 | 
 34 | Then every coefficient has absolute value (1). Thus
 35 | [
 36 | a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_6\in{-1,1}.
 37 | ]
 38 | The only coefficient magnitude is (1), so the root condition is exactly (P(1)=0).
 39 | 
 40 | Suppose exactly (r) of the seven coefficients (a_0,\ldots,a_6) equal (1). Then
 41 | [
 42 | P(1)=1+r-(7-r)=2r-6.
 43 | ]
 44 | Thus (P(1)=0) precisely when (r=3). Hence this case contributes
 45 | [
 46 | \binom73=35
 47 | ]
 48 | polynomials.
 49 | 
 50 | ### Case 2: (A>1)
 51 | 
 52 | Since (A) is odd, (A\ge 3). Write
 53 | [
 54 | a_i=\varepsilon_i A^{\delta_i},
 55 | \qquad
 56 | \varepsilon_i\in{-1,1},\quad
 57 | \delta_i\in{0,1}.
 58 | ]
 59 | Because (|a_0|=A), we have (\delta_0=1).
 60 | 
 61 | We use the following elementary observation: if (A\ge3), (|c_j|\le2), and
 62 | [
 63 | \sum_{j=0}^n c_jA^j=0,
 64 | ]
 65 | then every (c_j=0). Indeed, if (n) is the largest index for which (c_n\ne0), then
 66 | [
 67 | |c_n|A^n\ge A^n,
 68 | ]
 69 | whereas
 70 | [
 71 | \left|\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}c_jA^j\right|
 72 | \le 2\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}A^j
 73 | =\frac{2(A^n-1)}{A-1}
 74 | \le A^n-1,
 75 | ]
 76 | a contradiction.
 77 | 
 78 | Now
 79 | [
 80 | 0=P(A)=A^7+\sum_{i=0}^6\varepsilon_iA^{i+\delta_i}.
 81 | ]
 82 | After collecting equal powers of (A), every resulting coefficient has absolute value at most (2). Hence every such coefficient must vanish.
 83 | 
 84 | Starting with the highest powers gives successively:
 85 | [
 86 | \delta_6=1,\qquad \varepsilon_6=-1,
 87 | ]
 88 | [
 89 | \delta_5=0,
 90 | ]
 91 | [
 92 | \delta_4=1,\qquad \varepsilon_4=-\varepsilon_5,
 93 | ]
 94 | [
 95 | \delta_3=0,
 96 | ]
 97 | [
 98 | \delta_2=1,\qquad \varepsilon_2=-\varepsilon_3,
 99 | ]
100 | [
101 | \delta_1=0,
102 | ]
103 | [
104 | \delta_0=1,\qquad \varepsilon_0=-\varepsilon_1.
105 | ]
106 | 
107 | Consequently, for some (s,t,u\in{-1,1}),
108 | [
109 | \begin{aligned}
110 | P(x)
111 | &=x^7-Ax^6+sx^5-sAx^4+tx^3-tAx^2+ux-uA\
112 | &=(x-A)\bigl(x^6+sx^4+tx^2+u\bigr).
113 | \end{aligned}
114 | ]
115 | 
116 | The leading coefficient has absolute value (1), so (1) must also be a root. As (A\ne1),
117 | [
118 | 0=P(1)=(1-A)(1+s+t+u),
119 | ]
120 | and therefore
121 | [
122 | 1+s+t+u=0.
123 | ]
124 | Thus
125 | [
126 | s+t+u=-1,
127 | ]
128 | which means exactly one of (s,t,u) equals (1) and the other two equal (-1). There are therefore exactly
129 | [
130 | 3
131 | ]
132 | polynomials for each admissible (A>1).
133 | 
134 | Conversely, every polynomial of this form with exactly one of (s,t,u) positive has coefficient magnitudes (1) and (A), and both (1) and (A) are roots, so all such polynomials are indeed good.
135 | 
136 | Finally,
137 | [
138 | 2025^2=4,100,625.
139 | ]
140 | The number of odd integers (A) satisfying
141 | [
142 | 1<A<4,100,625
143 | ]
144 | is
145 | [
146 | \frac{4,100,625-3}{2}=2,050,311.
147 | ]
148 | Hence the total number of good polynomials is
149 | [
150 | 35+3(2,050,311)
151 | =35+6,150,933
152 | =\boxed{6,150,968}.
153 | ]

The \emph{short summary} should be a brief phrase (we will later turn these into reusable codes); the \emph{detailed description} should give the full explanation. Mark each as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Trivial} -- those listed under \texttt{NME} which we won't penalise;
	\item \emph{Minor} -- those listed under \texttt{ME} which could turn $7 \to 6$; or
	\item \emph{Major} -- those listed under \texttt{NEC} which would drop a solution to $0/1$
\end{itemize}
guided by the markscheme.

\paragraph{Exception for fundamentally wrong solutions.} If the solution is \emph{entirely} wrong (so the mark is clearly $0$), you do \textbf{not} need to rigorously catalogue every single error. Label the most serious ones --- enough to justify the mark --- and add a final row (or a note) recording that there were further minor errors which you have not itemised.

\paragraph{What counts as an error.} Flag as errors not only false statements and logical gaps, but also issues such as \textbf{answering the wrong problem}, \textbf{using a different set of conditions from those given in the problem} (e.g.\ silently changing or weakening a hypothesis), proving a different statement from the one asked, or assuming what was to be proved. Record these with an appropriate severity (usually \emph{major}).

\section*{4. Proof quality (qualitative)}

These two questions capture \emph{stylistic} qualities of the write-up for our later analysis. They do \textbf{not} affect the 0/1/6/7 mark --- answer them independently of the score. Choose one option per question (the examples are there to keep graders consistent).

\subsection*{4a. Readability}
\textit{How much difficulty did you have following the proof? (Was it easy to read, or did you have to re-read passages to understand them?)}

\medskip
\textbf{Choose one:} \qquad \fbox{None} \qquad \fbox{A bit} \qquad \fbox{A lot}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.6em, nosep]
    \item \textbf{None} --- read smoothly in a single pass; steps, notation, and structure were clear throughout.
    \item \textbf{A bit} --- mostly clear, but a few passages needed re-reading (e.g.\ a terse step, ambiguous notation, or a slightly confusing ordering).
    \item \textbf{A lot} --- frequently hard to follow; had to re-read many parts, reconstruct missing links, or untangle a disorganised argument.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\fillin{Optional: a sentence or two on the worst readability issues, with line numbers.}

\subsection*{4b. Conciseness}
\textit{How much unnecessary or inefficient content was there? (Were lemmas proved efficiently, or was there significant irrelevant / repetitive material?)} Judge \textbf{local} optimisations only --- e.g.\ a sub-argument proved more verbosely than needed, or repetition --- \emph{not} whether the overall approach takes a globally sub-optimal route.

\medskip
\textbf{Choose one:} \qquad \fbox{None} \qquad \fbox{A bit} \qquad \fbox{A lot}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.6em, nosep]
    \item \textbf{None} --- tight throughout; lemmas proved efficiently, with little or no wasted content.
    \item \textbf{A bit} --- some redundancy or slightly laboured steps, but nothing major (e.g.\ a lemma proved more verbosely than necessary, or a little repetition).
    \item \textbf{A lot} --- substantial irrelevant or repetitive content, or several sub-arguments proved far less efficiently than they could have been.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\fillin{Optional: a sentence or two on the main conciseness issues, with line numbers.}

## What to produce

1. **Complete the grading sheet** above:
   - Fill in the header (Problem `5_POLYGO`, Submission `model_5`, your grader
     initials — use `AI` — and today's date).
   - **Section 1:** indicate the single proposed mark (0/1/6/7), e.g. by wrapping the chosen
     `\fbox{...}` in `\boxed`/highlight or removing the other three boxes — make the choice
     unambiguous.
   - **Section 2:** justify the mark with explicit reference to markscheme points (e.g. `ME1`,
     `NEC3`), and complete the "Significantly different approach?" box (or write `N/A`).
   - **Section 3:** log **every** error/issue in the table with line number(s), a short
     summary, a detailed description, and severity (trivial/minor/major).
   - **Section 4:** select one option for each of 4a (readability) and 4b (conciseness).
   - Replace every `\fillin{[...]}` placeholder and delete the brackets.
2. **Return the completed template as a single `.tex` file**, suggested filename
   `grade_5_POLYGO_model_5_AI.tex`.
3. **Check it compiles.** Run `pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode <file>.tex` and fix any
   errors so it builds to a PDF. (Keep the document self-contained — do not add external
   dependencies.)
4. **State the proposed mark** (0/1/6/7) clearly in your final message.

Do **not** commit anything to the repository — return the `.tex` (and its PDF if produced).
